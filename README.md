## UC Admissions Gender Bias Analysis
If you were a man applying to Berkeley's graduate school in 1973, you were almost twice as likely to be admitted as your female peers. On the surface, this seems to have been a flagrant case of gender discrimination. However, a closer inspection of the data reveals that women were more likely to apply to departments where the admission rate was lower overall, which was the true reason for any difference between the sexes.

The Berkeley problem is a classic example of Simpson's paradox â€“ an important concept in statistics where an effect disappears or even reverses when you control for other factors. Knowledge of this concept can prove critical in areas such as education policy, human resources, or any other field where bias or discrimination is a concern.


## Text Analysis on Bad Passwords Using NIST Guidelines
Almost every web service you join will require you to come up with a password. But what makes a good password? In June 2017 the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) published publication 800-63B titled Digital Identity Guidelines: Authentication and Lifecycle Management. This publication doesn't tell you what is a good password, but it does have specific rules for what is a bad password.

In this project, you will take a list of user passwords and, using publication 800-63B, you will write code that automatically detects and flags the bad passwords.

## Qualities of the Best Chocolate Bars
Gourmet chocolates are high-quality chocolates created with the best beans and processes to deliver a rich aroma, smooth texture, and an even, velvety taste. Gourmet chocolates include more cocoa, have a shinier appearance, and are more expensive than plain chocolates.

The taste is the most noticeable distinction between conventional chocolate and premium chocolate. Gourmet chocolate melts in the mouth like velvet, whereas ordinary chocolate may taste waxy or uneven. It is necessary to learn about the qualities of highly rated gourmet chocolate bars in order to understand what the target market wants from manufacturers.
